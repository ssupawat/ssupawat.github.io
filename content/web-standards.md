The web moves fast. New frameworks appear weekly. Build tools change monthly.

But web standards? They endure.

## What Are Web Standards?

Web standards are the agreed-upon specifications that make the web work:

- HTML for structure
- CSS for presentation
- JavaScript for behavior
- HTTP for communication

These aren't arbitrary choices. They're consensus. They're what every browser implements.

## The Framework Trap

When you build with a popular framework, you're making a bet:

1. That the framework will be maintained
2. That it won't break backwards compatibility
3. That developers will want to work with it
4. That you can migrate away when you need to

Most of these bets fail.

### The Cost of Abstraction

Every layer of abstraction is:

- Something to learn
- Something that can break
- Something between you and the platform
- Something that adds load time

## The Standards Advantage

When you build with standards:

1. **Your code works everywhere** - That's the point of standards
2. **It never breaks** - Backwards compatibility is sacred on the web
3. **Anyone can understand it** - Standards are well-documented
4. **It's performant** - No overhead from abstractions
5. **It's future-proof** - Standards only change slowly

## A Philosophy

Building with standards isn't about being old-fashioned. It's about building to last.

The web was designed to be resilient. To work on any device, any browser, any connection. When you use standards properly, you inherit that resilience.

## The Long View

In five years, your framework-based app will likely need a complete rewrite.

Your standards-based site? It'll still work.

And that's the point.
