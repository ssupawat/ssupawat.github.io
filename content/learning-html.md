When I decided to learn web development properly, everyone told me to start with a framework. "Just use React," they said. "It's what everyone uses."

But I wanted to understand what I was building. So I decided to build something from first principles: a simple blog.

## The Journey Begins

Starting with raw HTML feels intimidating. There are no components, no state management, no build tools. Just files and tags.

But that's exactly the point.

### Understanding the Fundamentals

When you build from scratch, you learn:

1. **How the DOM actually works** - Not through a framework's abstraction, but as it truly is
2. **CSS fundamentals** - Flexbox, grid, and the cascade without utility classes hiding everything
3. **Semantic HTML** - Why `<article>` matters more than `<div class="card">`
4. **File systems and build processes** - How your code becomes something a browser can read

## The Inductive Approach

I call this "inductive design." Start with the content - the blog posts - and build outward.

Content comes first. The structure supports the content. The styling presents the content.

This is how the web was meant to be.

## What I Built

A minimalist static site generator that:

- Converts Markdown to HTML
- Generates clean, semantic pages
- Uses no frameworks
- Is easy to understand and modify

And in building it, I learned more about web development than any tutorial could teach.

## The Value of Simplicity

When you strip away the abstractions, you see how things actually work. And that understanding is worth more than any framework.
