Images can make your blog posts more engaging and help illustrate your points. Here's how to add images to your posts.

## How to Add Images

### Step 1: Place Your Image

Put your image files in the `assets/images/` folder. Supported formats include JPG, PNG, GIF, and WebP.

### Step 2: Reference in Markdown

Use standard Markdown image syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text description](/assets/images/your-image.jpg)
```

### Example

Here's an example with a placeholder image:

## Tips for Images

- **Use descriptive alt text** for accessibility
- **Optimize images** before uploading (keep file sizes small)
- **Use appropriate formats**:
  - JPG: Photos and complex images
  - PNG: Graphics with transparency
  - WebP: Modern format with better compression

## Image Sizing

Images will automatically scale to fit the content width. For best results, use images that are 800-1200px wide.

Happy blogging!
