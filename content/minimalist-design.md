Minimalist design isn't about removing things until there's nothing left. It's about removing everything that doesn't matter.

## What Matters?

In a blog, what matters is the content. The words. The ideas.

Everything else - navigation, sidebars, advertisements, social media buttons - is distraction.

### The No-Border Strategy

One of the most powerful design principles I've discovered: **don't use borders**.

Borders add visual noise. They say "look at me, I'm an element."

Instead, use space.

Let your content breathe. Let the empty space around elements define their boundaries. Use typography and spacing to create hierarchy.

## Typography-First Design

When you remove borders, shadows, and other decorations, typography becomes your primary tool.

- Font weight creates emphasis
- Size establishes hierarchy
- Line spacing affects readability
- Letter spacing influences tone

## Vertical Rhythm

On the web, we scroll vertically. Design for that.

Center your content vertically on the homepage. Give each section room to breathe. Let the reader's eyes move naturally down the page.

## The Result

A design that:

- Feels lighter
- Is easier to read
- Loads faster
- Works on any device
- Never goes out of style

Because it's not about trends. It's about the content.

## Simplicity is Hard

"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

Minimalist design is difficult because it requires confidence. Confidence that your content is strong enough to stand alone.
